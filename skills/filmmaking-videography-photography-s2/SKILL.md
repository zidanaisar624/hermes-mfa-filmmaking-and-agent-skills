# Filmmaking, Directing, Videography, and Photography (S1-S2 MFA Curriculum)

Provide graduate-level (MFA) mastery of film directing, screenwriting, cinematography (videography), still photography, editing, color grading, sound design, and production management across short-form vertical media (YouTube Shorts, Reels, TikTok), long-form YouTube videos (documentaries, video essays, tutorials), and narrative cinema.

## When to Use

- The user asks to plan, write, direct, shoot, edit, color-grade, or produce a short film, feature film, YouTube video, documentary, commercial, or social media video.
- The user wants a single bot to act as a complete "One-Man Film Studio" (handling all roles from Director and DP to Editor) or wants multiple bots (Shizuka, Kiki-Chii, Shikaku, Val, Yukino) to divide film crew departments.
- The user needs technical guidance on videography or photography (exposure triangle, lenses, lighting setups, composition, color science, camera movement, or audio engineering).
- The user wants to execute a media production workflow in Hermes using ArtCraft MCP servers (`filmcraft`, `effectcraft`, `photocraft`, `lightcraft`, `soundcraft`, `designcraft`, `vectorcraft`, `figcraft`, `deckcraft`, `wordcraft`, `gridcraft`, `craft_anything`), Blender MCP, or FFmpeg.

## Step 1: Select Crew Operating Mode (Single-Bot vs. Multi-Bot Crew)

Determine whether the project runs in **Mode A (Single-Bot Full-Stack Filmmaker)** or **Mode B (Multi-Bot Studio Crew)**:

1. **Mode A - Single-Bot "One-Man Studio" (1 Bot = All 8 Crew Roles)**:
   - One bot sequentially executes all 8 department heads: (1) Executive/Line Producer, (2) Screenwriter, (3) Film Director, (4) Director of Photography (DP) / Master Photographer, (5) Production Designer / Gaffer, (6) Lead Editor, (7) Colorist & VFX Supervisor, and (8) Sound Designer / Re-Recording Mixer.

2. **Mode B - Multi-Bot Hermes Studio Crew (5 Bots by Department)**:
   - **Shizuka Hiratsuka (Director & Showrunner)**: Owns creative vision, Director's Treatment, dramatic arc, mise-en-scene, actor/voice blocking, and final cut sign-off.
   - **Kiki-Chii (Director of Photography, Master Photographer, Art Director & Colorist)**: Owns camera/lens selection, lighting ratios, composition, storyboards, thumbnails, and color grading (`photocraft`, `lightcraft`, `designcraft`, `vectorcraft`, `figcraft`).
   - **Shikaku Nara (Technical Director, Lead Editor, VFX/3D Supervisor & Audio Engineer)**: Owns NLE assembly, Walter Murch pacing, keyframes, 3D previz, audio mixing, and rendering pipelines (`filmcraft`, `effectcraft`, `soundcraft`, `blender`, `ffmpeg`).
   - **Val (Screenwriter, Story Researcher & Script Supervisor)**: Owns 3-Act / Story Circle / YouTube Retention scripts, two-column AV scripts, Fountain screenplays, and continuity (`wordcraft`, `pdfcraft`, `craft_anything`).
   - **Yukino Yukinoshita (Executive Producer, Line Producer & 1st AD)**: Owns shooting schedules, stripboards, budgets, call sheets, energy-adaptive shoot pacing, and vocal prosody coaching (`gridcraft`, `deckcraft`).

## Step 2: Execute the 5-Phase S1-S2 MFA Production Pipeline

### Phase 1: Development & Screenwriting (Story Architecture)

1. Choose the structural paradigm matched to the target medium:
   - **Short-Form Vertical (9:16, 15-60s)**: Hook (0-3s visual + verbal disruption) -> Setup/Stakes (3-10s) -> Escalating Value/Beats (10-45s, visual change every 2-3s) -> Payoff & Loop/CTA (45-60s).
   - **Long-Form YouTube (16:9, 8-25+ min)**: Cold Open Hook (0-15s confirming click promise) -> Retention Bridge & Thesis Stakes (15-45s) -> Chaptered Story/Analysis Segments with Pattern Interrupts every 60-90s -> Climax Payoff -> Native Outro.
   - **Narrative Cinema / Anime Short or Feature**: 3-Act Structure (Setup, Confrontation, Resolution), Dan Harmon's 8-Step Story Circle, Blake Snyder's 15 Beats, or 4-Act Japanese **Kishotenketsu** (Ki: Introduction, Sho: Development, Ten: Twist/Subversion, Ketsu: Reconciliation).
2. Draft the script in **Fountain Screenplay Format** (for narrative film, 1 page = ~1 minute screen time) or **Two-Column Audio/Visual (AV) Script** (Left column: Spoken Dialogue/VO + SFX/Music at ~130-150 WPM; Right column: Shot Size, Camera Movement, B-Roll, and Text On-Screen).

See `references/mfa-directing-screenwriting.md` for full lecture notes and templates.

### Phase 2: Pre-Production & Directing (Mise-en-Scene, Coverage & Scheduling)

1. Translate subtext into physical staging (**Blocking & Mise-en-Scene**): define character objectives, obstacles, tactics, and spatial power dynamics (vertical height, proximity, depth).
2. Build the **Master Shot List & Coverage Plan**:
   - Establish geography with an Establishing / Wide Shot (EWS/WS), anchor conversation with Medium Shots (MS) and Over-the-Shoulder (OTS), and reserve Close-Ups (CU/ECU) for emotional turning points.
   - Maintain the **180-Degree Axis of Action Rule** and **30-Degree Camera Angle Rule** so cuts never jar spatial orientation unless deliberately signaling psychological disorientation.
3. Lock the **Shooting Schedule (1st AD Stripboard)**: group shots by location, lighting direction, and lens size rather than chronological script order to minimize setup turnaround.

### Phase 3: Cinematography (Videography) & Master Photography

Apply rigorous optical and photographic physics to every frame (real camera, Blender 3D camera, or AI visual prompt):

1. **Exposure Triangle & Motion Physics**:
   - **Aperture (f-stop)**: Controls Depth of Field (DoF) and light intake ($f/1.4 - f/2.8$ for shallow subject isolation; $f/5.6 - f/11$ for deep sharpness).
   - **Shutter Speed & 180-Degree Rule**: In videography, lock shutter angle to $180^\circ$ where $\text{Shutter Speed} = \frac{1}{2 \times \text{FPS}}$ (e.g., $24\text{ fps} \rightarrow 1/48\text{s}$ or $1/50\text{s}$; $60\text{ fps} \rightarrow 1/120\text{s}$) for natural motion blur. Use Neutral Density (ND) filters outdoors rather than cranking shutter speed.
   - **ISO & Dynamic Range**: Expose at the sensor's Native / Dual-Native ISO to maximize dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Place Caucasian/Asian skin tones around **60-70 IRE** on False Color / Zebra meters; protect highlights in Log profiles (S-Log3, C-Log, V-Log, ARRI LogC).
2. **Optics & Focal Length Psychology**:
   - **14mm-24mm (Ultra-Wide/Wide)**: Expands space, exaggerates depth and movement, creates dynamic tension or claustrophobic distortion up close.
   - **35mm-50mm (Standard/Natural Human Vision)**: Grounded documentary intimacy and natural perspective (`35mm` environmental portrait; `50mm` classic human eye).
   - **85mm-135mm+ (Telephoto)**: Compresses background distance, isolates the subject with creamy bokeh, and intensifies emotional focus.
3. **Lighting Design & Inverse Square Law ($I \propto 1/d^2$)**:
   - Design **Motivated Lighting**: every Key Light, Fill Light, and Back/Rim (Hair) Light must have a believable diegetic source (window, lamp, street neon, monitor glow).
   - Control **Lighting Ratios**: **2:1** (High-Key, beauty, upbeat YouTube), **4:1** (Natural dramatic narrative, Rembrandt triangle), **8:1+** (Low-Key, Film Noir, Chiaroscuro tension).
   - Balance **Color Temperature (Kelvin)**: Warm Tungsten/Candlelight (`2700K-3200K`) vs. Daylight (`5600K`) vs. Cool Shade/Moonlight (`6500K-8000K`). Use mixed color temperatures (e.g., `3200K` warm key against `5600K` cool background fill) for instant cinematic color separation.

See `references/mfa-cinematography-photography.md` for full mathematical formulas and lighting diagrams.

### Phase 4: Post-Production (Editing, Color Grading, VFX & Sound Design)

1. **Film Editing - Walter Murch's Rule of Six**:
   Evaluate every cut in strict priority order:
   - (1) **Emotion (51%)**: Does the cut serve the emotional truth of the moment?
   - (2) **Story (23%)**: Does the cut advance the narrative or thesis?
   - (3) **Rhythm (10%)**: Does the cut happen at the right musical/cadence beat?
   - (4) **Eye-Trace (7%)**: Does the viewer's focus land cleanly on the next frame's point of interest?
   - (5) **2D Plane of Screen (5%)**: Does the cut respect screen direction and axis?
   - (6) **3D Space of Action (4%)**: Does the cut preserve physical room continuity?
2. **J-Cuts, L-Cuts & Montage**:
   - Lead audio by 4-15 frames before the video cut (**J-Cut**) or trail audio into the next shot (**L-Cut**) so dialogue and transitions breathe naturally.
3. **Color Correction & Color Grading**:
   - Transform Log footage to Working Color Space (**ACEScct / DaVinci Wide Gamut**), balance exposure on the **Waveform** (0-100 IRE), neutralize white balance on the **RGB Parade**, align skin tones along the **Vectorscope Skin-Tone Line**, apply creative look/palette, and output to **Rec.709 (Gamma 2.4)**.
4. **Sound Design & Loudness Mastering**:
   - Layer **Dialogue/VO** (centered, high-pass filter at `80-100 Hz`, gentle 3:1 compression, de-esser, peaking at `-6 dBFS` to `-3 dBFS`), **Room Tone / Ambience** (`-30` to `-24 dBFS`), **Foley & SFX** (`-18` to `-10 dBFS`), and **Music Score** (ducked to `-24` to `-18 dBFS` under voice).
   - Master integrated loudness to **`-14 LUFS` (`-1.0 dBTP` True Peak)** for YouTube/Social Platforms or **`-24 LKFS` (`-2.0 dBTP`)** for Cinema/Broadcast.

### Phase 5: Hermes ArtCraft & Blender Cross-App Execution

When executing inside Hermes on Windows (`D:\HermesData`), chain the local MCP servers using explicit saved files in a dedicated project subfolder:

1. **`craft_anything`** (`project.cany`): Write the creative brief, research evidence, and production plan (`core_brief_write`, `core_plan_update`, `core_report_save`).
2. **`wordcraft`** (`.docx`/`.pdf`) & **`gridcraft`** (`.xlsx`): Generate the Fountain/AV Script, Call Sheet, Shot List, and Budget (`new_document`, `new_workbook`, `write_range`).
3. **`designcraft`** (`.designcraft`) / **`figcraft`** (`.figcraft`) / **`vectorcraft`** (`.svg`): Build storyboards, moodboards, title cards, and lower-thirds.
4. **`blender`** (`.blend`): Build 3D camera pre-visualization (previz), test lens focal lengths (24mm/35mm/50mm/85mm), simulate 3-point lighting, and render 3D sequences.
5. **`photocraft`** & **`lightcraft`**: Composite thumbnails/stills (`doc_new`, `doc_save`, `doc_export`) and develop/color-grade photo libraries (`import`, `set_develop`, `export`).
6. **`filmcraft`** (`.fcproj`), **`effectcraft`** (`.ecproj`), & **`soundcraft`** (`.soundcraft`): Import media (`media_import`), assemble timeline sequences, animate keyframes (`add_keyframe`, `render_frame`), mix audio (`import_audio`, `bounce_mix`), and render final preview/export (`render_preview`).

See `references/mfa-editing-color-sound-artcraft.md` for complete ArtCraft MCP command workflows.

## Gotchas

- Never sacrifice **Emotion (51%)** and **Story (23%)** for flashy transitions or unmotivated camera movement.
- In `lightcraft`, only one process can hold an active library lock at a time; close GUI locks before running CLI MCP operations.
- Always save native project files (`.fcproj`, `.ecproj`, `.soundcraft`, `.designcraft`, `.blend`) alongside exported deliverables (`.mp4`, `.png`, `.wav`, `.pdf`) so edits can be resumed without starting from scratch.
