# Filmmaking, Directing, Videography, and Photography (S1-S2 MFA Curriculum)

Provide graduate-level (MFA) mastery of film directing, screenwriting, cinematography (videography), still photography, editing, color grading, sound design, and production management across short-form vertical media (YouTube Shorts, Reels, TikTok), long-form YouTube videos (documentaries, video essays, tutorials), and narrative cinema.

## When to Use

- The user asks to plan, write, direct, shoot, edit, color-grade, or produce a short film, feature film, YouTube video, documentary, commercial, or social media video.
- The user wants a single bot to act as a complete "One-Man Film Studio" (handling all roles from Director and DP to Editor) or wants multiple bots (Shizuka, Kiki-Chii, Shikaku, Val, Yukino) to divide film crew departments.
- The user needs technical guidance on videography or photography (exposure triangle, lenses, lighting setups, composition, color science, camera movement, or audio engineering).
- The user wants to execute a media production workflow in Hermes using ArtCraft MCP servers (`filmcraft`, `effectcraft`, `photocraft`, `lightcraft`, `soundcraft`, `designcraft`, `vectorcraft`, `figcraft`, `deckcraft`, `wordcraft`, `gridcraft`, `craft_anything`), Blender MCP, or FFmpeg.

## Step 1: Select Crew Operating Mode (Single-Bot vs. Multi-Bot Crew)

Determine whether the project runs in **Mode A (Single-Bot Full-Stack Filmmaker)** or **Mode B (Multi-Bot Studio Crew)**:

1. **Mode A - Single-Bot "One-Man Studio" (1 Bot = All 8 Crew Roles)**:
   - One bot sequentially executes all 8 department heads: (1) Executive/Line Producer, (2) Screenwriter, (3) Film Director, (4) Director of Photography (DP) / Master Photographer, (5) Production Designer / Gaffer, (6) Lead Editor, (7) Colorist & VFX Supervisor, and (8) Sound Designer / Re-Recording Mixer.

2. **Mode B - Multi-Bot Hermes Studio Crew (5 Bots by Department)**:
   - **Shizuka Hiratsuka (Director & Showrunner)**: Owns creative vision, Director's Treatment, dramatic arc, mise-en-scene, actor/voice blocking, and final cut sign-off.
   - **Kiki-Chii (Director of Photography, Master Photographer, Art Director & Colorist)**: Owns camera/lens selection, lighting ratios, composition, storyboards, thumbnails, and color grading (`photocraft`, `lightcraft`, `designcraft`, `vectorcraft`, `figcraft`).
   - **Shikaku Nara (Technical Director, Lead Editor, VFX/3D Supervisor & Audio Engineer)**: Owns NLE assembly, Walter Murch pacing, keyframes, 3D previz, audio mixing, and rendering pipelines (`filmcraft`, `effectcraft`, `soundcraft`, `blender`, `ffmpeg`).
   - **Val (Screenwriter, Story Researcher & Script Supervisor)**: Owns 3-Act / Story Circle / YouTube Retention scripts, two-column AV scripts, Fountain screenplays, and continuity (`wordcraft`, `pdfcraft`, `craft_anything`).
   - **Yukino Yukinoshita (Executive Producer, Line Producer & 1st AD)**: Owns shooting schedules, stripboards, budgets, call sheets, energy-adaptive shoot pacing, and vocal prosody coaching (`gridcraft`, `deckcraft`).

See `references/single-vs-multibot-crew-roles.md` for complete handoff protocols.

## Step 2: Execute the 5-Phase S1-S2 MFA Production Pipeline

### Phase 1: Development & Screenwriting (Story Architecture)

1. Choose the structural paradigm matched to the target medium:
   - **Short-Form Vertical (9:16, 15-60s)**: Hook (0-3s visual + verbal disruption) -> Setup/Stakes (3-10s) -> Escalating Value/Beats (10-45s, visual change every 2-3s) -> Payoff & Loop/CTA (45-60s).
   - **Long-Form YouTube (16:9, 8-25+ min)**: Cold Open Hook (0-15s confirming click promise) -> Retention Bridge & Thesis Stakes (15-45s) -> Chaptered Story/Analysis Segments with Pattern Interrupts every 60-90s -> Climax Payoff -> Native Outro.
   - **Narrative Cinema / Anime Short or Feature**: 3-Act Structure (Setup, Confrontation, Resolution), Dan Harmon's 8-Step Story Circle, Blake Snyder's 15 Beats, or 4-Act Japanese **Kishotenketsu** (Ki: Introduction, Sho: Development, Ten: Twist/Subversion, Ketsu: Reconciliation).
2. Draft the script in **Fountain Screenplay Format** (for narrative film, 1 page = ~1 minute screen time) or **Two-Column Audio/Visual (AV) Script** (Left column: Spoken Dialogue/VO + SFX/Music at ~130-150 WPM; Right column: Shot Size, Camera Movement, B-Roll, and Text On-Screen).

See `references/mfa-directing-screenwriting.md` for full lecture notes and templates.

### Phase 2: Pre-Production & Directing (Mise-en-Scene, Coverage & Scheduling)

1. Translate subtext into physical staging (**Blocking & Mise-en-Scene**): define character objectives, obstacles, tactics, and spatial power dynamics (vertical height, proximity, depth).
2. Build the **Master Shot List & Coverage Plan**:
   - Establish geography with an Establishing / Wide Shot (EWS/WS), anchor conversation with Medium Shots (MS) and Over-the-Shoulder (OTS), and reserve Close-Ups (CU/ECU) for emotional turning points.
   - Maintain the **180-Degree Axis of Action Rule** and **30-Degree Camera Angle Rule** so cuts never jar spatial orientation unless deliberately signaling psychological disorientation.
3. Lock the **Shooting Schedule (1st AD Stripboard)**: group shots by location, lighting direction, and lens size rather than chronological script order to minimize setup turnaround.

### Phase 3: Cinematography (Videography) & Master Photography

Apply rigorous optical and photographic physics to every frame (real camera, Blender 3D camera, or AI visual prompt):

1. **Exposure Triangle & Motion Physics**:
   - **Aperture (f-stop)**: Controls Depth of Field (DoF) and light intake ($f/1.4 - f/2.8$ for shallow subject isolation; $f/5.6 - f/11$ for deep sharpness).
   - **Shutter Speed & 180-Degree Rule**: In videography, lock shutter angle to $180^\circ$ where $\text{Shutter Speed} = \frac{1}{2 \times \text{FPS}}$ (e.g., $24\text{ fps} \rightarrow 1/48\text{s}$ or $1/50\text{s}$; $60\text{ fps} \rightarrow 1/120\text{s}$) for natural motion blur. Use Neutral Density (ND) filters outdoors rather than cranking shutter speed.
   - **ISO & Dynamic Range**: Expose at the sensor's Native / Dual-Native ISO to maximize dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Place Caucasian/Asian skin tones around **60-70 IRE** on False Color / Zebra meters; protect highlights in Log profiles (S-Log3, C-Log, V-Log, ARRI LogC).
2. **Optics & Focal Length Psychology**:
   - **14mm-24mm (Ultra-Wide/Wide)**: Expands space, exaggerates depth and movement, creates dynamic tension or claustrophobic distortion up close.
   - **35mm-50mm (Standard/Natural Human Vision)**: Grounded documentary intimacy and natural perspective (`35mm` environmental portrait; `50mm` classic human eye).
   - **85mm-135mm+ (Telephoto)**: Compresses background distance, isolates the subject with creamy bokeh, and intensifies emotional focus.
3. **Lighting Design & Inverse Square Law ($I \propto 1/d^2$)**:
   - Design **Motivated Lighting**: every Key Light, Fill Light, and Back/Rim (Hair) Light must have a believable diegetic source (window, lamp, street neon, monitor glow).
   - Control **Lighting Ratios**: **2:1** (High-Key, beauty, upbeat YouTube), **4:1** (Natural dramatic narrative, Rembrandt triangle), **8:1+** (Low-Key, Film Noir, Chiaroscuro tension).
   - Balance **Color Temperature (Kelvin)**: Warm Tungsten/Candlelight (`2700K-3200K`) vs. Daylight (`5600K`) vs. Cool Shade/Moonlight (`6500K-8000K`). Use mixed color temperatures (e.g., `3200K` warm key against `5600K` cool background fill) for instant cinematic color separation.

See `references/mfa-cinematography-photography.md` for full mathematical formulas and lighting diagrams.

### Phase 4: Post-Production (Editing, Color Grading, VFX & Sound Design)

1. **Film Editing - Walter Murch's Rule of Six**:
   Evaluate every cut in strict priority order:
   - (1) **Emotion (51%)**: Does the cut serve the emotional truth of the moment?
   - (2) **Story (23%)**: Does the cut advance the narrative or thesis?
   - (3) **Rhythm (10%)**: Does the cut happen at the right musical/cadence beat?
   - (4) **Eye-Trace (7%)**: Does the viewer's focus land cleanly on the next frame's point of interest?
   - (5) **2D Plane of Screen (5%)**: Does the cut respect screen direction and axis?
   - (6) **3D Space of Action (4%)**: Does the cut preserve physical room continuity?
2. **J-Cuts, L-Cuts & Montage**:
   - Lead audio by 4-15 frames before the video cut (**J-Cut**) or trail audio into the next shot (**L-Cut**) so dialogue and transitions breathe naturally.
3. **Color Correction & Color Grading**:
   - Transform Log footage to Working Color Space (**ACEScct / DaVinci Wide Gamut**), balance exposure on the **Waveform** (0-100 IRE), neutralize white balance on the **RGB Parade**, align skin tones along the **Vectorscope Skin-Tone Line**, apply creative look/palette, and output to **Rec.709 (Gamma 2.4)**.
4. **Sound Design & Loudness Mastering**:
   - Layer **Dialogue/VO** (centered, high-pass filter at `80-100 Hz`, gentle 3:1 compression, de-esser, peaking at `-6 dBFS` to `-3 dBFS`), **Room Tone / Ambience** (`-30` to `-24 dBFS`), **Foley & SFX** (`-18` to `-10 dBFS`), and **Music Score** (ducked to `-24` to `-18 dBFS` under voice).
   - Master integrated loudness to **`-14 LUFS` (`-1.0 dBTP` True Peak)** for YouTube/Social Platforms or **`-24 LKFS` (`-2.0 dBTP`)** for Cinema/Broadcast.

### Phase 5: Hermes ArtCraft & Blender Cross-App Execution

When executing inside Hermes on Windows (`D:\HermesData`), chain the local MCP servers using explicit saved files in a dedicated project subfolder:

1. **`craft_anything`** (`project.cany`): Write the creative brief, research evidence, and production plan (`core_brief_write`, `core_plan_update`, `core_report_save`).
2. **`wordcraft`** (`.docx`/`.pdf`) & **`gridcraft`** (`.xlsx`): Generate the Fountain/AV Script, Call Sheet, Shot List, and Budget (`new_document`, `new_workbook`, `write_range`).
3. **`designcraft`** (`.designcraft`) / **`figcraft`** (`.figcraft`) / **`vectorcraft`** (`.svg`): Build storyboards, moodboards, title cards, and lower-thirds.
4. **`blender`** (`.blend`): Build 3D camera pre-visualization (previz), test lens focal lengths (24mm/35mm/50mm/85mm), simulate 3-point lighting, and render 3D sequences.
5. **`photocraft`** & **`lightcraft`**: Composite thumbnails/stills (`doc_new`, `doc_save`, `doc_export`) and develop/color-grade photo libraries (`import`, `set_develop`, `export`).
6. **`filmcraft`** (`.fcproj`), **`effectcraft`** (`.ecproj`), & **`soundcraft`** (`.soundcraft`): Import media (`media_import`), assemble timeline sequences, animate keyframes (`add_keyframe`, `render_frame`), mix audio (`import_audio`, `bounce_mix`), and render final preview/export (`render_preview`).

See `references/mfa-editing-color-sound-artcraft.md` for complete ArtCraft MCP command workflows.

## Gotchas

- Never sacrifice **Emotion (51%)** and **Story (23%)** for flashy transitions or unmotivated camera movement.
- In `lightcraft`, only one process can hold an active library lock at a time; close GUI locks before running CLI MCP operations.
- Always save native project files (`.fcproj`, `.ecproj`, `.soundcraft`, `.designcraft`, `.blend`) alongside exported deliverables (`.mp4`, `.png`, `.wav`, `.pdf`) so edits can be resumed without starting from scratch.

# S1-S2 MFA Module 1: Directing, Screenwriting, and Story Architecture
*(Synthesized from USC School of Cinematic Arts, AFI Conservatory, and NYU Tisch Graduate Film Curricula)*

## 1. Narrative Architecture Across Formats

### A. Narrative Cinema & Short Films (3-Act, Story Circle, Save the Cat, Kishotenketsu)
1. **Classical Three-Act Dramatic Structure (Syd Field / Robert McKee)**:
   - **Act I - Setup (0% - 25%)**: Establish the Protagonist's Status Quo (Lie They Believe), Inciting Incident (~10%), and Plot Point 1 / Threshold (~25%) where the protagonist makes an irreversible choice.
   - **Act II - Confrontation (25% - 75%)**: Rising action & Fun and Games (25% - 50%), **Midpoint Shift (50%)** (false victory or false defeat that raises the stakes and shifts the protagonist from *reactive* to *proactive*), Bad Guys Close In (50% - 75%), **All Hope Is Lost / Dark Night of the Soul (~75%)**.
   - **Act III - Resolution (75% - 100%)**: Synthesis of External Want and Internal Need, Climax (80% - 92%) where the protagonist proves transformation through action, and Denouement / New Equilibrium (92% - 100%).
2. **Japanese / Anime 4-Act Structure (Kishotenketsu - 起承転結)**:
   - Ideal for atmospheric, slice-of-life, philosophical, or anime-inspired storytelling (e.g., Makoto Shinkai, Kyoto Animation, Oregairu):
     - **Ki (起 - Introduction)**: Introduce characters, setting, and emotional baseline.
     - **Sho (承 - Development)**: Deepen relationships and daily rhythms without requiring violent conflict.
     - **Ten (転 - Twist / Shift in Perspective)**: Introduce an unexpected angle, revelation, or juxtaposition that reframes everything seen in Ki and Sho.
     - **Ketsu (結 - Reconciliation / Resonance)**: Bring Ki, Sho, and Ten into emotional harmony, leaving a lingering thematic resonance (*Mono no Aware* / *Ma* - the beauty of negative space and pause).

### B. YouTube Long-Form (16:9) Retention Engineering (8 - 30+ Minutes)
1. **The 0-30 Second Golden Window**:
   - **0-5s (Click Confirmation)**: Immediately validate the title and thumbnail promise—zero channel intros, zero "Hey guys, welcome back".
   - **5-15s (Curiosity Gap / Stakes)**: Open a specific narrative loop or question that can only be resolved by watching through the video.
   - **15-30s (Retention Bridge / Proof of Value)**: Show a brief preview of the scale of the experiment, story, or framework so the viewer trusts the journey.
2. **Body Architecture (Mini-Hooks & Pattern Interrupts)**:
   - Structure the body into 3 to 5 distinct chapters. End each chapter with a **Mini-Cliffhanger ("But that created a bigger problem...")** rather than a flat summary so retention never drops at chapter boundaries.
   - Insert a **Pattern Interrupt every 60-90 seconds**: change framing (WS to CU), switch from A-roll to B-roll/diagram, shift music stems, or introduce a tangible prop/screen recording.
3. **The Ending (Zero Pre-Roll Sign-Off)**:
   - Deliver the final payoff and transition into the next recommended video within the final 10 seconds without saying "In conclusion" or "Thanks for watching" (which triggers immediate viewer drop-off).

### C. Short-Form Vertical (9:16 - YouTube Shorts, Reels, TikTok, 15-60 Seconds)
- **0-2s (Visual + Verbal Hook)**: Motion in Frame 1 + bold 3-5 word on-screen caption + punchy opening statement.
- **2-12s (Compression of Context)**: Cut all throat-clearing; establish the conflict or insight immediately.
- **12-50s (Rapid Escalation)**: Average Shot Length (ASL) of **1.5 to 2.5 seconds** (via physical cuts, punch-ins, B-roll overlays, or dynamic captions).
- **50-60s (Payoff + Seamless Loop)**: Connect the final sentence grammatically or rhythmically back into the first 2 seconds for >100% loop retention.

---

## 2. The Director's Craft: Mise-en-Scene, Subtext, and Blocking

### A. Translating Subtext into Visuals ("Show, Don't Tell")
A film director never directs "emotions" (e.g., "act sad" or "act angry"); a director directs **Actionable Verbs (Tactics)** driven by an **Objective** against an **Obstacle**:
- Instead of telling an actor or voice actor "be nervous," give a playable action: *"Try to convince your partner everything is fine while hiding the trembling in your hands."*

### B. Blocking & Spatial Geometry (3 Shapes of Staging)
1. **The I-Formation (Confrontation / Intimacy)**: Two characters face each other directly on a single axis.
2. **The A-Formation (Triangle Staging)**: Two characters face each other while a third anchor point (an object, a window, or a third character in depth) forms the apex of a triangle in the frame.
3. **The L-Formation (90-Degree Tension)**: One character looks straight ahead while the other looks at them from a perpendicular angle (classic for unspoken tension or emotional distance, as seen frequently in *Oregairu* clubroom scenes).

### C. Standard Two-Column AV Script & Shot List Template

| Scene / Beat | Timecode | Visual / Camera / Lighting (DP & Art Direction) | Audio / Dialogue / SFX / Music (Sound & Prosody) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1A - HOOK** | `00:00 - 00:04` | **CU** (85mm, f/2.0, 1/50s, 3200K warm key left, 5600K cool rim). Slow dolly-in on subject's eyes. | **[SFX]**: Low sub-bass riser (`-16 dBFS`) + crisp clock tick.<br>**[VO - Shizuka]**: *(Calm contralto, 0.93x)* "Satu kesalahan kecil di baris kode ini..." |
| **1B - REVEAL** | `00:04 - 00:10` | **Match Cut to EWS** (24mm, f/4.0). Screen illuminates dark room in teal glow. | **[SFX]**: Soft mechanical keyboard thock.<br>**[MUSIC]**: Minimalist lo-fi piano enters (`-22 dBFS`). |

# S1-S2 MFA Module 2: Cinematography (Videography) & Master Photography
*(Optical Physics, Exposure Science, Lighting Ratios, and Visual Composition)*

## 1. Exposure Science & Sensor Physics

### A. The Exposure Triangle & Reciprocity
Total luminous exposure $H$ reaching the sensor plane is governed by scene luminance $L$, lens T-stop/f-number $N$, and exposure time (shutter speed) $t$:
$$H = \frac{q \cdot L \cdot t}{N^2}$$
1. **Aperture ($N = f/D$)**:
   - Full-stop scale: $f/1.0, f/1.4, f/2.0, f/2.8, f/4.0, f/5.6, f/8.0, f/11, f/16, f/22$.
   - Each full stop halves the light area ($\div 2$) and multiplies Depth of Field.
2. **Shutter Speed & The 180-Degree Shutter Rule (Videography vs. Photography)**:
   - **In Videography / Cinema**: Motion cadence requires a $180^\circ$ rotary shutter equivalent:
     $$t = \frac{1}{2 \times \text{FPS}}$$
     - **24 fps (Cinema Narrative)**: $1/48\text{ s}$ (or $1/50\text{ s}$ in 50Hz PAL/Indonesia regions to prevent AC lighting flicker).
     - **25 fps (PAL Broadcast/YouTube)**: $1/50\text{ s}$.
     - **30 fps (Digital Standard)**: $1/60\text{ s}$.
     - **60 fps / 120 fps (Slow Motion B-Roll)**: $1/120\text{ s}$ or $1/240\text{ s}$.
     - *Creative Override*: $45^\circ - 90^\circ$ shutter ($1/200\text{ s} - 1/500\text{ s}$ at 24fps) creates staccato, hyper-visceral action (*Saving Private Ryan* effect); $270^\circ - 360^\circ$ shutter ($1/24\text{ s}$) creates dreamy step-printed motion blur (*Wong Kar-wai* effect).
   - **In Still Photography**:
     - Handheld sharpness rule: $t \le \frac{1}{\text{Effective Focal Length}}$ (e.g., at least $1/100\text{ s}$ for an 85mm lens).
     - Freeze fast action/sports: $1/1000\text{ s} - 1/4000\text{ s}$.
     - Long-exposure light trails / silky waterfalls: $1\text{ s} - 30\text{ s}$ on tripod with ND filter.
3. **ISO, Dual Native ISO & False Color IRE Mapping**:
   - Keep ISO at the camera's **Base Native ISO** (e.g., ISO 800 and ISO 3200/12800 on dual-native cinema sensors) to preserve maximum dynamic range (14+ stops) above the noise floor.
   - **False Color / IRE Exposure Targets (Rec.709 / Monitoring LUT)**:
     - **0 - 5 IRE (Purple/Blue)**: Crushed black clipping (avoid unless silhouette).
     - **18% Middle Gray**: **38 - 42 IRE (Green)**.
     - **Skin Tones (Key Light Side)**: **55 - 70 IRE (Pink / Light Gray)**.
     - **95 - 100 IRE (Yellow/Red)**: Specular highlight clipping.

---

## 2. Optical Physics, Focal Lengths & Depth of Field

### A. Hyperfocal Distance & Depth of Field Formula
$$H = \frac{f^2}{N \cdot c} + f$$
where $f$ is focal length, $N$ is f-number, and $c$ is the circle of confusion (~$0.03\text{ mm}$ on Full-Frame $36 \times 24\text{ mm}$). When focused at $H$, everything from $H/2$ to infinity ($\infty$) is acceptably sharp.

### B. Psychological Dictionary of Focal Lengths (Full-Frame Equivalent)
| Focal Length | Field of View | Spatial & Psychological Effect | Classic Use Cases |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **14mm - 20mm** | Ultra-Wide | Expands room scale, exaggerates Z-axis motion speed, distorts facial features at close distance. | Architecture, vast landscapes, psychological disorientation (Emmanuel Lubezki style). |
| **24mm - 28mm** | Wide | Dynamic environmental immersion; keeps background context legible while framing full-body action. | Establishing shots, walk-and-talk gimbal shots, vlogging, dynamic narrative scenes. |
| **35mm** | Master Wide-Normal | The quintessential cinema master lens: wide enough for environment, tight enough for natural faces. | Two-shots, over-the-shoulder (OTS), documentary storytelling, street photography. |
| **50mm** | Standard Normal | Matches human binocular perspective and compression; neutral, honest, unforced intimacy. | Dialogue medium shots, narrative realism (Yasujiro Ozu / anime clubroom framing). |
| **85mm - 105mm** | Portrait Telephoto | Flattering facial proportions, strong background compression, creamy bokeh subject isolation. | Emotional Close-Ups (CU), interviews, product hero shots, portrait photography. |
| **135mm - 200mm+** | Long Telephoto | Extreme Z-axis compression (background looms large behind subject), voyeuristic or epic isolation. | Cinematic compressed street shots, sports/wildlife, high-tension surveillance feel. |

---

## 3. Lighting Science, Inverse Square Law & Classic Setups

### A. The Inverse Square Law of Light Falloff
$$I \propto \frac{1}{d^2}$$
- Placing a softbox **close** to the subject (e.g., $1\text{ m}$ away) creates **rapid falloff** behind the subject (dramatic dark background contrast) and wraps softly around the face (because apparent source size is large).
- Placing a light **far** from the subject (e.g., $4\text{ m}$ away) creates **even illumination** across both the subject and the background (ideal for lighting a whole room evenly).

### B. Five Essential Cinematic Lighting Setups
1. **Three-Point Lighting (Key + Fill + Back/Hair Light)**:
   - **Key Light**: $30^\circ - 45^\circ$ off camera axis, $15^\circ - 30^\circ$ above eye level, diffused through a large softbox/scrim.
   - **Fill Light (or Negative Fill)**: Opposite the Key. Use a bounce card for **2:1** or **4:1** ratio, or a black flag (**Negative Fill**) for **8:1** cinematic shadow depth.
   - **Back / Rim / Kicker Light**: Behind the subject opposite the Key to carve the shoulders and hair out from the background.
2. **Rembrandt Lighting**: Key light positioned high and $45^\circ$ to the side so a small **illuminated triangle** appears on the shadow-side cheek beneath the eye.
3. **Book Lighting (Ultra-Soft Beauty / Mommy ASMR Visual Look)**: Bounce a strong light into a $4\times 4$ white bleached muslin/bounce board, then pass the bounced light through a $4\times 4$ diffusion frame ($1/2$ Grid or Opal). Produces velvety, zero-glare wrap ideal for calm, intimate close-ups.
4. **Chiaroscuro / Low-Key Lighting**: High contrast (**8:1 to 16:1** ratio), hard or snooted key light, deep shadows, smoke/haze for volumetric shafts.
5. **Color Contrast (Teal & Amber / Practical Motivated Lighting)**: Warm `2800K-3200K` practical tungsten lamp as the motivated Key/Rim against a `5600K-6500K` cool ambient room or window fill.

# S1-S2 MFA Module 3: Editing, Color Grading, Sound Design & Hermes ArtCraft Pipeline

## 1. Film Editing Theory & Pacing

### A. Walter Murch's "Rule of Six" (*In the Blink of an Eye*)
Never make a cut without evaluating these 6 criteria in descending order of importance:
1. **Emotion (51%)**: How will this cut make the audience feel right now? If the emotion is right and the other 5 are slightly imperfect, the audience will forgive the cut.
2. **Story (23%)**: Does this cut advance the narrative or argument? (Emotion + Story = **74%** of editing).
3. **Rhythm (10%)**: Does the cut occur at a musically and visually satisfying beat?
4. **Eye-Trace (7%)**: Where is the viewer's eye looking on Frame A (last frame of outgoing shot), and does Frame B (first frame of incoming shot) place the new focal point in that exact screen quadrant?
5. **Planarity / 2D Screen Plane (5%)**: Does the cut respect the 180-degree line and screen direction?
6. **3D Continuity of Space (4%)**: Does the cut respect the physical geography of the room?

### B. Cut Taxonomy & Montage Techniques
- **Standard Hard Cut**: Instant transition on action (**Cutting on Action** hides the edit seam because the eye tracks movement).
- **J-Cut (Audio Lead)**: The incoming shot's audio begins `4 - 15 frames` *before* the video cut (makes dialogue feel anticipatory and natural).
- **L-Cut (Audio Trail)**: The outgoing shot's audio continues `4 - 20 frames` *after* cutting to the reaction shot or B-roll.
- **Match Cut (Graphic / Action / Audio Match)**: Bridges two disparate locations or times by matching geometry, motion vector, or sound.
- **Jump Cut**: Cuts along the same camera axis (<30 degrees difference) to compress time or inject high-energy urgency in YouTube/Shorts editing.

---

## 2. Color Science & Grading Pipeline

### A. The 4-Node / 4-Stage Color Grading Workflow (DaVinci Resolve / `LightCraft` / `FilmCraft`)
1. **Node 1 - Color Space Transform (CST In) & Primary Balance**:
   - Normalize exposure using **Lift** (Shadows), **Gamma** (Midtones), **Gain** (Highlights), and **Offset** (Global exposure) while watching the **Waveform** (`5 IRE` black floor to `95 IRE` highlight ceiling).
2. **Node 2 - White Balance & Contrast Ratio**:
   - Align neutral grays across Red, Green, and Blue channels on the **RGB Parade** and set an S-Curve contrast pivot around middle gray (`40 IRE`).
3. **Node 3 - Skin Tone Isolation & Secondary Qualifiers**:
   - Isolate skin tones using Hue-vs-Hue / Hue-vs-Saturation or HSL Qualifier and align them precisely along the **Vectorscope Skin-Tone Line (I-Line)** with `40% - 55%` saturation.
4. **Node 4 - Creative Look & Color Harmony**:
   - Apply split-toning (e.g., cool teal shadows in Lift + warm amber/gold midtones/highlights in Gamma/Gain), halation, film grain, and vignette to guide Eye-Trace.

---

## 3. Production Sound & Psychoacoustic Mixing

### A. Target Loudness & True Peak Standards
| Target Platform | Integrated Loudness | Max True Peak | Dialogue Peak Range |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **YouTube / Shorts / TikTok / Reels / Spotify** | **`-14 LUFS`** ($\pm 1	ext{ LU}$) | **`-1.0 dBTP`** | `-6 dBFS` to `-3 dBFS` |
| **Cinema / Netflix / Broadcast TV (EBU R128 / ATSC A/85)** | **`-24 LKFS / LUFS`** | **`-2.0 dBTP`** | `-12 dBFS` to `-6 dBFS` |

### B. Vocal & Mommy ASMR / Narrative Dialogue Processing Chain (`SoundCraft` / DAW)
1. **High-Pass Filter (HPF)**: Roll off rumble below `75 Hz - 90 Hz` (`12 dB/oct` or `18 dB/oct`).
2. **Subtractive EQ**: Cut boxy room resonance around `250 Hz - 400 Hz` (`-2 to -3 dB`, Q=2.0); add subtle velvety chest warmth at `120 Hz - 160 Hz` (`+1.5 dB` for *Mommy ASMR / Baritone* presence) and silky air shelf above `10 kHz` (`+1.5 dB`).
3. **De-Esser**: Tame harsh sibilance (`s`, `sh`, `ch`) between `5.5 kHz - 8.5 kHz`.
4. **Two-Stage Compression**:
   - Fast FET peak catcher (`4:1` ratio, fast attack `5 ms`, fast release `50 ms`, `2-3 dB` gain reduction).
   - Slow Opto leveling compressor (`2:1` ratio, medium attack `20 ms`, smooth release `200 ms`, `2-3 dB` gain reduction) for intimate, consistent close-mic warmth.
5. **Sidechain Ducking on Music Bus**: Duck background music by `-4 dB` to `-6 dB` (especially in the `1 kHz - 4 kHz` vocal clarity band) whenever dialogue/VO is active.

## 4. Hermes ArtCraft MCP + Blender + FFmpeg Execution Pipeline
*(Grounded in `Buku_Manual_Hermes_ArtCraft_dan_Aplikasi_Lain.pdf` on `D:\HermesData`)*

When Hermes executes a film, video, or photography project on Zidan's computer, follow the **Cross-App File Handoff Rule** (always create a dedicated project subfolder, save native editable files first, and export verified deliverables):

| Production Stage | Hermes MCP Server / Tool | Native File | Export Deliverable & Verification Step |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Brief & Pre-Production Plan** | **`craft_anything`** (`craft-anything-cli.exe`) | `project.cany` | Call `core_brief_write`, `core_plan_update`, and `core_report_save` to save the Director's Treatment & Production Brief `.md`. |
| **2. Script & Call Sheet** | **`wordcraft`** (`wordcraft-cli.exe`) | `.docx` | Call `new_document`, `type_text`, `save_document`, and `render_page` to generate the AV Script / Screenplay `.docx` & `.pdf`. |
| **3. Budget, Stripboard & Shot List** | **`gridcraft`** (`gridcraft-cli.exe`) | `.xlsx` | Call `new_workbook`, `write_range`, `evaluate_formula`, and `save_workbook` to build the Shot List & Schedule `.xlsx`. |
| **4. Storyboard, Lookbook & Graphics** | **`designcraft`**, **`figcraft`**, **`vectorcraft`** | `.designcraft`, `.figcraft`, `.svg` | Build storyboard frames (`create_node`, `place_image`, `export_png`) and vector title/lower-third assets (`draw_shape`, `add_text`, `export`). |
| **5. 3D Previz, Camera Blocking & CGI** | **`blender`** (Blender 5.2+ MCP on `127.0.0.1:9876` / `19876`) | `.blend` | Set virtual camera focal length (e.g., 35mm/85mm), test 3-point lighting, save `.blend`, and render PNG/animation sequences. |
| **6. Photography & Thumbnail Grading** | **`photocraft`** & **`lightcraft`** | Native layered + Library | Composite layers in `photocraft` (`doc_new`, `doc_save`, `doc_export`) and grade color/exposure in `lightcraft` (`import`, `set_develop`, `export`). |
| **7. Video Editing & Timeline Assembly** | **`filmcraft`** (`filmcraft-cli.exe`) | `.fcproj` | Run `media_import`, assemble sequence cuts via `command_run`, inspect via `project_inspect`, save `.fcproj`, and run `render_preview`. |
| **8. VFX, Motion Graphics & Keyframes** | **`effectcraft`** (`effectcraft-cli.exe`) | `.ecproj` | Run `get_project`, `set_property`, `add_keyframe`, save `.ecproj`, and verify with `render_frame`. |
| **9. Audio Mixing & Loudness Master** | **`soundcraft`** (`soundcraft-cli.exe`) | `.soundcraft` | Run `new_session`, `import_audio`, mix dialogue + SFX + music, save `.soundcraft`, and export final audio via `bounce_mix`. |

# S1-S2 MFA Module 4: Single-Bot "One-Man Studio" vs. Multi-Bot Hermes Crew Architecture

## 1. Mode A: Single-Bot "One-Man Studio" (1 Bot Menjadi Semua Peran Film Maker)
Ketika Zidan meminta **1 bot saja** (misalnya hanya berbicara dengan **Kiki-Chii**, **Shizuka**, atau **Shikaku**) untuk membuat film pendek, video YouTube panjang, YouTube Shorts, atau proyek fotografi dari nol sampai selesai, bot tersebut otomatis menjalankan **8 Topi Kru Film (8-Hat Filmmaker State Machine)** secara berurutan:
1. **[ROLE 1: SHOWRUNNER & PRODUCER]** -> Menentukan tujuan penonton, target platform (YouTube 16:9 / Shorts 9:16 / Cinema), durasi, dan jadwal kerja yang ramah energi (6D Parenting).
2. **[ROLE 2: SCREENWRITER]** -> Menulis *Hook* 0-15 detik, struktur 3-Babak / *Kishotenketsu* / *Hook-Bridge-Body-Payoff*, dan naskah **Two-Column AV Script** atau **Fountain Screenplay**.
3. **[ROLE 3: FILM DIRECTOR]** -> Menyusun *Director's Treatment*, *blocking* adegan, arah emosi (*subtext*), dan *Master Shot List* (EWS, WS, MS, CU, ECU, OTS).
4. **[ROLE 4: DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY (DP) & MASTER PHOTOGRAPHER]** -> Menentukan lensa (mm), *Exposure Triangle* ($f$-stop, *180-degree shutter speed*, Native ISO), *Lighting Ratio* (2:1, 4:1, 8:1), *Kelvin temperature*, dan komposisi visual (atau *prompt* visual AI / scene 3D Blender).
5. **[ROLE 5: PRODUCTION DESIGNER & ART DIRECTOR]** -> Merancang *color palette*, properti latar (*practical lights*), tipografi judul, dan *Thumbnail High-CTR* (`PhotoCraft`, `DesignCraft`, `VectorCraft`).
6. **[ROLE 6: LEAD FILM EDITOR]** -> Menyusun *Rough Cut* hingga *Fine Cut* menggunakan **Walter Murch's Rule of Six** (Emotion 51%, Story 23%, Rhythm 10%, Eye-Trace 7%, 2D Plane 5%, 3D Space 4%), *J-Cut*, *L-Cut*, dan *Pattern Interrupts* (`FilmCraft`).
7. **[ROLE 7: COLORIST & VFX COMPOSITOR]** -> Mengatur *Color Grading* (Lift-Gamma-Gain, Skin-Tone Vectorscope, Teal & Amber / Cinematic LUT) serta animasi *keyframe* (`LightCraft`, `EffectCraft`).
8. **[ROLE 8: SOUND DESIGNER & RE-RECORDING MIXER]** -> Merancang *dialogue chain*, *Mommy ASMR / Baritone vocal prosody*, *Foley*, *ambience*, *ducking* musik, dan *mastering* ke **`-14 LUFS`** (`SoundCraft`).

| **`[KIKI-CHII]`**<br>Kiki-Chii | **Director of Photography (DP / Sinematografer), Master Photographer, Art Director & Colorist** | Merancang komposisi kamera, lensa, skema pencahayaan (*3-Point, Book Light, Rembrandt, Chiaroscuro*), memotret & mengedit foto/thumbnail (`photocraft`, `lightcraft`), serta membuat *storyboard*, *lookbook*, dan aset grafis (`designcraft`, `figcraft`, `vectorcraft`). |
| **`[SHIKAKU]`**<br>Shikaku Nara | **Technical Director (TD), Lead Editor, VFX/3D Previz Supervisor & Sound Engineer** | Mengeksekusi perakitan video di `filmcraft` (`.fcproj`), komposisi efek & *keyframe* di `effectcraft` (`.ecproj`), simulasi kamera/cahaya 3D di `blender` (`.blend`), *mixing/mastering* audio `-14 LUFS` di `soundcraft` (`.soundcraft`), serta otomatisasi skrip `FFmpeg` / Python. |
| **`[VAL]`**<br>Val | **Lead Screenwriter, Documentary Researcher & Script Supervisor** | Melakukan riset mendalam, menulis naskah *Screenplay / Two-Column AV Script* di `wordcraft` (`.docx`/`.pdf`), menjaga *continuity* antar-adegan, serta menyusun narasi edukasi/dokumenter yang tajam. |
| **`[YUKINO]`**<br>Yukino Yukinoshita | **Executive Producer, Line Producer & 1st Assistant Director (1st AD)** | Menyusun jadwal syuting/produksi yang ramah energi Zidan (6D Parenting + *Zero-Guilt Pacing*), membuat *Stripboard*, *Shot List*, & *Budget* di `gridcraft` (`.xlsx`), *Pitch Deck* di `deckcraft` (`.pptx`), serta menjaga kualitas prosodi *Mommy ASMR Voice-Over*. |
